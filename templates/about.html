        <h3>Optimizing Traffic Flow with Smart Vision-Based Traffic Lights</h3>
        <p>A dynamic traffic light system that leverages computer vision and artificial intelligence to optimize traffic flow in real-time.</p>
        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Cameras</h4>
                <p>Four cameras positioned strategically around each traffic light capture vehicle and emergency vehicle presence on each road approaching the intersection.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Processing Unit</h4>
                <p>An on-site or cloud-based processing unit analyzes the camera feed in real-time using machine learning models.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="animate__animated animate__backInRight">
        <h3>Software</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Vehicle Counting & Classification</h4>
                <p>Machine learning algorithms trained on image data accurately count vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks) on each side of the intersection.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Traffic Flow Analysis</h4>
                <p>AI models analyze the traffic density and predict congestion patterns based on historical data and real-time vehicle counts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Adaptive Traffic Signal Timing</h4>
                <p>The system dynamically adjusts the green light duration for each direction based on real-time traffic demand, prioritizing the side with heavier congestion.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Emergency Vehicle Detection</h4>
                <p>Machine learning models identify emergency vehicles (ambulances, fire trucks, police cars) approaching the intersection through flashing lights or sirens.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Priority Lane Creation</h4>
                <p>For identified emergency vehicles, the system prioritizes the corresponding traffic light, significantly reducing their wait time and facilitating faster response.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="animate__animated animate__backInUp">
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Reduced traffic congestion</h4>
                <p>Optimizing traffic flow leads to shorter waiting times, smoother traffic movement, and decreased fuel consumption, thereby impacting fuel efficiency and emissions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Improved infrastructure utilization</h4>
                <p>Dynamically adjusting traffic light timing reduces wear and tear on road infrastructure compared to fixed timing schedules.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Potential for data-driven insights</h4>
                <p>Traffic data collected by the system can inform future infrastructure planning and road construction projects.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sustainable Cities & Communities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
